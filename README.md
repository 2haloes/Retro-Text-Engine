# Retro text engine

## What is this?

It's a web based retro text engine, designed to be as good as I could make it

## Features

* Text scrolls character by character
* Skip scrolling text by clicking/tapping the box while text is displaying
* Completely framework independent
* Fully customable
* Lightweight (1/3rd of the default size is from supplied assets)
* Design is responsive, works as well on mobile as it does on PC

## Why even make this?

Well I made a promise of treats, failed that promise and now I apparently make birthday e-cards using home made engines

## What improvements could be made?

The only way from here is up! (Probably)

It could be improved to be a CYOA or visual novel engine

If anyone wants to give it a go, feel free, as long as it all works, I'll likely accept pull requests

I may improve this later but I have other big things to focus on

## Can I reuse this?

Feel free, this project (With the exception of the talking.mp3 asset file (see credits section)) is formally under the Unlicense or MIT if for any reason, the Unlicense isn't trusted. 

Less formally, this is licensed under Beerware or the WTFPL

### Why does this have 4 licenses?

* I enjoy the freedom of choice
* This wasn't a serious project but if someone wants to use it for serious things, I want to respect that (Not like I can stop you with these licenses anyway)
* I don't drink beer but a cursing license isn't the best and I couldn't find the best of both worlds
* I'd make this some kind of careware but I couldn't find a good license. On that note, do something nice for someone, even if it doesn't include buying anyone beer, I can't make you but I might as well try if you're still reading.

## Development Time

This tool roughly 11 hours to get to version 1.0

The current version took about 14 hours of work (mainly stripping away framework bits)

I edited characters so that dots are dots and not heart shaped. The only license text is "feel free to use." so I wouldn't use it in anything professional but it's what I could find.
